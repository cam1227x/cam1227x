I'm a sixteen year old Low-Level programmer, linux user, ethical hacker, and overall computer geek. I am particularly fond of systems-level programming, 
and am currently learning C & kernel development. Though I also have plans of learning rust in the future! I also really enjoy participating in online 
cyber-security competitions, as well as game jams. Thanks for checking my page out =)!
