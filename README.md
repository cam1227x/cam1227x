I'm a sixteen year old Low-Level programmer, linux user, ethical hacker, and overall computer geek 💻. I Really enjoy learning about systems-level programming, and 
am currently learning C & kernel development, though I also have plans of learning rust in the future! I also really enjoy participating in online cyber-security
competitions, as well as game jams 👾. Thanks for checking my page out =)!
